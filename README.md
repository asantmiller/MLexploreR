# MLexploreR
This tool acts as a lightweight machine learning evaluation portal, currently focused on structured data alone. A user can test a variety of machine learning models on data, while also assessing various features and statistical measures of the data.

The application has three core interfaces:
1) Data Import:
    - Upload data, explore features, assess data sizing and feature distributions
    - Currently, data is preloaded
2) Feature Analysis:
    - View the data in tabular form, identify feature correlations, explore dimension reduction techniques, and test which features are worth using as predictors
3) Model Performance Evaluation:
    - Configure a machine learning training and testing regimen, deploy various model types within this regimen, and measure model performance

NOTE: This application is not meant to develop production or implementation models. It is purely demonstrative of both the strengths and weaknesses of user interface machine learning design.
